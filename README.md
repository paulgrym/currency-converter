# Currency converter
Hello!
This is another task that I'm doing as a part of the Frontend Developer course. This time I've made the currency converter. With its help you can convert PLN to EUR, USD or CZK. 
## Demo
You can find a demo [here](https://paulgrym.github.io/currency_converter/).
Try it out using the instrucions from "How to use section".
## How to use
1. Type in the "Kwota" field how much PLN you want to exchange.
2. In "Waluta" field choose the currency for which you want to echange your PLN - you can choose EUR, USD or CZK.
3. After you choose the currency, "Aktualny kurs" (exchange rate) field will complete automatically. If you need, you can change it.
